<br>

# Installation :
git clone https://github.com/Mesh3l911/SQLi_Checker_v1.1.git
<br>

# Features :
I improved the beta version so that it has three different options instead of one <br>
<br>
-Collected Urls<br>
-By Dork<br>
-By IP<br>

also I've added 4 Blind SQLi types :<br>
<br>
1-Blind_SQLi_Conditional_Responses<br>
2-Blind_SQLi_Conditional_Errors<br>
3-Blind_SQLi_Time_Delays<br>
4-Blind_SQLi_Time_Delays_And_Information_retrieval<br>

Besides that the script now has multy-threading features , so that it can be much faster <br>

# Usage :

1-Fire up the script and choose one of the three options.<br>
2-Just insert whatever it asks.<br>
3-Enjoy the results ^_*<br>

P.s: ( inurl ) should stay at the same folder as the script
<br>
# Version :
